[]	// This is a very basic initial relationship setup
+A	// +A signifies relationship A; this will always be between 2 individual symbols.
()	// Parser will be quite forgiving

+A 	// this refers back to Relationship "A" as previously defined. Can use ++A to indicate consanguinity
--[]	Ciaran Bloggs // the "A" designation is not usually needed
--<2> 	2 unspecified

[] 	Tarquin Blair
+	// the initial definition of a relationship will always be between 2 people.
() 	Jemima Blair
--() 	Jenny Blair # the dashes will refer back to the previous "+" relationship at the same indent level
  +	// in this case Jenny is in a relationship with Cameron.
  [] 	Cameron Bloggs
  --() 	Lily Bloggs // their children are Lily and Timmy

[\] deceased male
(a) female with "a" flag
?can use pretty much any character as a flag within the individual brackets?
{[]} adoption brackets - NB: these differ from ACMG/CGS standards

relationship shorthand []+() for cases where you're not adding info outside the brackets
or
[] BLOGGS, Jethro
+() // unspecified female partner of Jethro

() BARNETT, Drusilla
+[] // unspecified male partner of Drusilla

[]++C()--[3](2) // consanguineous relationship, 3 male, 2 female
is equivalent to
	[]
	++C
	()
	--[3]
	--(2)
and quite easily expanded out in text if required.
Note that the format is really based around the concept of the SIBSHIP - parents & kids.
In this case the sibship ++C means sibship C, and there is a consanguineous relationship.

TWINS
All "kids" in a sibship are rendered as -- unless they are multiple births
-% is a DIZYGOTIC twin relationship to the sibling immediately above (rendered --)
%% is MONOZYGOTIC twin relationship to the sibling immediately above (who is rendered --)

DISEASE INDICATORS
Diseases have to be pre-defined in the KEY, and affected status indicated INSIDE the individual brackets.
KEY
	a: diabetes
	b: Breast cancer
	c: Pancreatic cancer
	d: learning disability
	e: epilepsy
