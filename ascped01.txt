# ASCPED01
# Example pedigree file
# Trying out some ideas to work on a spec

# PREDEFINE - you can do this to predefine individuals who will pop up later in the pedigree.
# Identify them with an ID starting with a %, eg %01 
# generally keep this for individuals important in the overall scheme of things

# things to think about:
# Primary objective is to make this easy to note down and to read for humans
# Secondary objective is to make it easy to read and validate by computers, and record in EHR
# Keen to keep the # character for code comments, rather than a symbol that does anything in the schema
# Possibilities for things to get a bit busy
# Placing the ID markers inside the parentheses - is this a good move?
# Additional in-line signifiers needed for DOB
# Personal *characteristics* inside the parentheses; additional info, eg spousal status, adoption status etc *outside*

# We could potentially make it even easier to enter, and then run a script over it to tidy it up.
# The following is identical to the first pedigree, and should be totally comprehensible.
# The asterisk indicates affected status. The patient name starts with the first alphabetic character.

# Need some convention in the individual line to pull out name, dob, testing info etc

$PEDIGREE # signifies start of Pedigree block - is this overkill?
